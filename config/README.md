# Config Directory

This folder is for persistent configuration files (e.g., device config, sensor profiles) as per Migration_Plan.md.

- Place config files here that are used for device setup and persistence.
- Example: config.json, sensors.json (if not in data/), network.json, etc.

Refer to Migration_Plan.md for architectural guidance.
